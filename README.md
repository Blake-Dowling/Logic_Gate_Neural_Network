Increments each parameter by equal amount, which is the amount specified as a parameter (INC_AMOUNT=) when creating the Neural object.

Obstacles: Understanding how the neural network is supposed to learn, particularly regarding deep learning. The activation function transforms output between layers non-linearly.
